# test-selectors

This repo shows how to reproduce an issue seen when working with `ember-test-selectors`.
Issue seen:
- When you run `ember build --prod` and look into the generated assets, you still see
`data-test-component` in the corresponding one, when you would have expected the selectors to be stripped.
